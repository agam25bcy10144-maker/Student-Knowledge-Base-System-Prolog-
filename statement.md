1. Problem Statement

Educational institutions and small academic environments often require a simple and efficient way to store and manage basic student information. Existing systems may be overly complex, costly, or unsuitable for small-scale use.
This project aims to provide a lightweight, Prolog-based student information system that enables users to store, retrieve, update, and analyze student data through logical rules and facts.


2. Scope of the Project

The project focuses on building a minimal knowledge-based system using Prolog to manage student records.
The scope includes:
Storing student information such as name, age, and course
Searching and retrieving student details
Adding and removing student records dynamically
Generating basic reports like total student count and full student listings
The project does not include advanced features such as authentication, graphical interfaces, database integration, or complex analytics.


3. Target Users

The system is intended for:
Students learning Prolog or logic programming
Lecturers and instructors teaching artificial intelligence, logic programming, or knowledge representation
Beginners who need a simple example of a Prolog-based knowledge base
Academic projects or demos requiring a lightweight student data management tool

4. High-Level Features

Data Retrieval
Retrieve full details of a student
Search students by specific course
Dynamic Data Update
Add new student entries to the knowledge base
Remove student entries
Reporting & Analytics
Count total number of students
Display all students with their details
Simple Knowledge Base Structure
Organized using Prolog facts and rules for easy understanding and modification
